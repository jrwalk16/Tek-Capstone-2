# Tek-Capstone-2

This is my completed Power BI capstone project for TekSystem Data Analyst boot camp. Once the files are downloaded open the .pbix file in Power BI. Clicking through the side panels of the page will navigate through the report. The logos on the middle of the dashboard page are buttons that can also be clicked to pull up some visualizations. Offensive and defensive player matrices have a drilldown feature so you can find out more information about a specific player.
